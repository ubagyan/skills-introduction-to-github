# AB Testing Configuration

This file contains the configuration for AB testing the AI system.

## Test Groups

### Group A (Control)
- Current system behavior
- Baseline performance metrics

### Group B (Experimental)  
- New AI features
- Enhanced functionality

## Metrics to Track

- User satisfaction scores
- Task completion rates
- Response accuracy
- Response time
- User engagement

## Test Configuration

```yaml
ab_test:
  name: "AI Usefulness Test"
  description: "Testing if the AI is useful before full deployment"
  groups:
    - name: "control"
      percentage: 50
      description: "Control group with baseline features"
    - name: "experimental"
      percentage: 50
      description: "Experimental group with new AI features"
  
  metrics:
    - satisfaction_score
    - completion_rate
    - accuracy
    - response_time
    - engagement_rate
    
  duration: "2 weeks"
  minimum_sample_size: 100
```

## Implementation Notes

- Use feature flags to control group assignment
- Track all metrics consistently across groups
- Ensure statistical significance before concluding
- Plan for rollback if experimental group performs poorly
